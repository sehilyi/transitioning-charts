    <h1>Introducing new chart types</h1>
    <p>
      This page is used to study the effect of introducing new chart types to a blind individual <br>
      by starting from a known chart type and explaining the transitions.
    </p>
    <h2>Sequence Logo</h2>
    <h3>Data</h3>
    <p>Here is the data.</p>
    <div id="seqlogo-data"></div>
    <h3>Direct introduction</h3>
    <div id="seqlogo-top"></div>
    <p>
      This is a chart with a x-axis and y-axis. The chart is filled with four letters, 'A', 'G', 'C', and 'T'. <br>
      Each has a specific color (A is green, G is yellow, C is blue, T is red). They are arranged in columns, stacked on top of each other. <br>
      The x-axis ranges from 0 to 9, and there are ten columns, one corresponding to each x-axis value. The y-axis ranges from 0 to 260.
    </p>
    <p>Pause here to sketch the chart.</p>
    <h3>Gradual introduction</h3>
    <p>
      We now introduce the sequence logo in three steps. We start with a bar chart, then transition to a stacked bar chart, <br>
      before introducing the sequence logo.
    </p>
