    <h1>Introducing new chart types</h1>
    <p>
      This page is used to study the effectivity of introducing new chart types to a blind individual,
      by comparing a direct approach to a gradual approach (starting from a known chart type and explaining the transitions).
    </p>
    <h2>Sequence Logo</h2>
    <h3>Data</h3>
    <p>Here is the data.</p>
    <div id="seqlogo-data"></div>
    <h3>Direct introduction</h3>
    <h4>Tasks</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Read the description
        <ul>
          <li>You can read the description a maximum number of three times.</li>
          <li>You can take as much time to take in the data as you want.</li>
          <li>You can not access the description or data after starting to draw.</li>
        </ul> 
      </li> 
      <li>Sketch the chart
        <ul>
          <li>SSketch the general appearance of the chart as accurate as possible.</li>
          <li>Focus on the visual elements. The chart does not need to follow the exact data.</li>
          <li>Use colors if possible.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Description</h4>
    <div id="seqlogo-top" role="img" alt="Alt is omitted on purpose for this study"></div>
    <p>
      This is a chart with a x-axis and y-axis. The chart is filled with four letters, 'A', 'G', 'C', and 'T'.
      Each has a specific color (A is green, G is yellow, C is blue, T is red). They are arranged in columns, stacked on top of each other.
      The x-axis ranges from 0 to 9, and there are ten columns, one corresponding to each x-axis value. The y-axis ranges from 0 to 260.
    </p>
    <h4>Task</h4>
    <p>Sketch the Chart</p>
    <h3>Gradual introduction</h3>
    <p>
      We now introduce the sequence logo in three steps. We start with a bar chart, then transition to a stacked bar chart, before introducing the sequence logo.

    <h4>Bar Chart</h4>

    <p>
      This is a bar chart.

    <h4>Stacked Bar Chart</h4>
